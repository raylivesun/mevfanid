Okay, here's a README.md that covers FreeBASIC syntax basics and a comparison of "command languages" (how you compile and run code) between Dart and FreeBASIC.

# FreeBASIC: Syntax Overview and Dart to FreeBASIC Command Comparison

This document provides a brief overview of FreeBASIC syntax and compares its command-line operations for compilation and execution with those of Dart.

## 1. FreeBASIC Syntax Overview

FreeBASIC is a high-level programming language, syntactically similar to Microsoft QuickBASIC, but with many modern extensions.

**Key Characteristics:**

*   **Case-Insensitive:** `MyVariable` is the same as `myvariable`.
*   **Explicit Variable Declaration:** Variables should generally be declared with `DIM`.
*   **Line-based:** Typically, one statement per line. Multiple statements on one line are separated by a colon (`:`).
*   **Comments:** Use an apostrophe (`'`) or `REM` (Remark).

**Basic Elements:**

*   **Variables and Data Types:**
    ```freebasic
    ' Declare variables
    DIM myInteger AS INTEGER
    DIM myString AS STRING
    DIM myDouble AS DOUBLE
    DIM myFlag AS BOOLEAN

    myInteger = 10
    myString = "Hello, FreeBASIC!"
    myDouble = 3.14159
    myFlag = TRUE
    ```
    Common types: `INTEGER`, `LONG`, `SINGLE`, `DOUBLE`, `STRING`, `BOOLEAN`, `BYTE`, `UBYTE`, etc.

*   **Input/Output:**
    ```freebasic
    PRINT "Enter your name: ";
    DIM name AS STRING
    INPUT name
    PRINT "Hello, " & name & "!" ' & is used for string concatenation
    ```

*   **Control Flow:**
    *   **IF-THEN-ELSE:**
        ```freebasic
        DIM age AS INTEGER
        age = 20
        IF age >= 18 THEN
            PRINT "Adult"
        ELSEIF age > 12 THEN
            PRINT "Teenager"
        ELSE
            PRINT "Child"
        END IF
        ```
    *   **FOR-NEXT Loop:**
        ```freebasic
        DIM i AS INTEGER
        FOR i = 1 TO 5
            PRINT "Iteration: "; i
        NEXT i
        ```
    *   **WHILE-WEND Loop:**
        ```freebasic
        DIM counter AS INTEGER
        counter = 0
        WHILE counter < 3
            PRINT "Counter: "; counter
            counter = counter + 1
        WEND
        ```
    *   **DO-LOOP:**
        ```freebasic
        DIM num AS INTEGER
        num = 1
        DO
            PRINT "Num: "; num
            num = num * 2
        LOOP WHILE num < 10 ' Or LOOP UNTIL num >= 10
        ```

*   **Procedures (SUBs) and Functions (FUNCTIONs):**
    ```freebasic
    ' Procedure (doesn't return a value)
    SUB GreetUser (userName AS STRING)
        PRINT "Greetings, " & userName
    END SUB

    ' Function (returns a value)
    FUNCTION AddNumbers (a AS INTEGER, b AS INTEGER) AS INTEGER
        RETURN a + b
    END FUNCTION

    ' Call them
    CALL GreetUser("Alice") ' CALL keyword is optional for SUBs
    DIM sumResult AS INTEGER
    sumResult = AddNumbers(5, 7)
    PRINT "Sum: "; sumResult
    ```

*   **Operators:**
    *   Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `MOD` (modulo), `\` (integer division), `^` (exponentiation)
    *   Comparison: `=`, `<>`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
    *   Logical: `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `XOR`

*   **Simple "Hello, World!" Example:**
    ```freebasic
    ' hello.bas
    PRINT "Hello, World!"
    SLEEP ' Pauses execution so the console window doesn't close immediately
    END   ' Optional, program ends implicitly
    ```

## 2. FreeBASIC Command Language (Compiling & Running)

FreeBASIC is a compiled language. The `fbc` command is its compiler.

1.  **Save your code:** Create a file, e.g., `myprogram.bas`.
2.  **Compile:**
    ```bash
    fbc myprogram.bas
    ```
    This creates an executable file. On Windows, it will be `myprogram.exe`. On Linux/macOS, it will be `myprogram`.
3.  **Run the Executable:**
    *   Windows: `myprogram.exe` or simply `myprogram`
    *   Linux/macOS: `./myprogram`

**Common Compiler Options:**

*   `-x <exename>`: Specify the output executable name.
    ```bash
    fbc myprogram.bas -x myapp
    ' Runs as: ./myapp (Linux/macOS) or myapp.exe (Windows)
    ```
*   `-w all`: Enable all warnings (recommended).
    ```bash
    fbc -w all myprogram.bas
    ```
*   `-g`: Add debugging symbols (for use with GDB).
    ```bash
    fbc -g myprogram.bas
    ```
*   `-run`: Compile and run the program immediately (useful for quick scripts).
    ```bash
    fbc -run myprogram.bas
    ```
    This creates a temporary executable, runs it, and then deletes it.

## 3. Dart Command Language Overview

Dart offers both Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation for development and Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation for deployment.

1.  **Save your code:** Create a file, e.g., `myprogram.dart`.
2.  **Run with JIT (Development):**
    ```bash
    dart run myprogram.dart
    ```
3.  **Compile to Native Executable (AOT):**
    ```bash
    dart compile exe myprogram.dart -o myapp_dart
    ```
    This creates `myapp_dart` (or `myapp_dart.exe` on Windows).
4.  **Run the Compiled Executable:**
    *   Windows: `myapp_dart.exe` or `myapp_dart`
    *   Linux/macOS: `./myapp_dart`

**Other Dart Commands:**

*   `dart format .`: Formats Dart code in the current directory.
*   `dart analyze .`: Analyzes Dart code for errors and warnings.
*   `dart pub get`: Gets dependencies for a Dart project (if using `pubspec.yaml`).

## 4. Dart to FreeBASIC Command Language Mapping

Here's a comparison of how common tasks are performed:

| Task                       | Dart Command                                       | FreeBASIC Command                                         | Notes                                                                                                |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Write Code**             | `your_editor myprogram.dart`                       | `your_editor myprogram.bas`                               | Use any text editor or IDE.                                                                          |
| **Run (Development/Quick)**| `dart run myprogram.dart`                          | `fbc -run myprogram.bas`                                  | Dart uses JIT. FreeBASIC compiles to a temporary native binary and runs it.                        |
| **Compile to Executable**  | `dart compile exe myprogram.dart -o myapp_dart`    | `fbc myprogram.bas -x myapp_fb`                           | Both produce native executables. `-o` in Dart is similar to `-x` in FreeBASIC for output name.       |
| **Run Compiled Executable**| `./myapp_dart` (Linux/macOS) `myapp_dart.exe` (Win) | `./myapp_fb` (Linux/macOS) `myapp_fb.exe` (Win)          | Standard execution of native binaries.                                                               |
| **Linting/Analysis**       | `dart analyze .`                                   | `fbc -w all myprogram.bas`                                | `fbc -w all` enables compiler warnings, which is the closest equivalent to static analysis.          |
| **Code Formatting**        | `dart format .`                                    | N/A (IDE-dependent or manual)                             | FreeBASIC doesn't have a standard command-line formatter like Dart. Relies on IDE features or tools. |
| **Dependency Management**  | `dart pub get` (uses `pubspec.yaml`)               | Manual (or via IDE/build system for larger projects)      | FreeBASIC requires manual linking or `#INCLUDE` for libraries.                                       |

## 5. Key Differences in "Command Language" Philosophy

*   **Compilation Model:**
    *   **Dart:** Can be JIT compiled (for speed during development) or AOT compiled to native machine code or JavaScript.
    *   **FreeBASIC:** Always AOT compiled to native machine code for the target platform. The `-run` flag is a convenience that hides the intermediate compilation step.

*   **Tooling Ecosystem:**
    *   **Dart:** Has a rich, integrated tooling ecosystem (`dart` CLI, `pub` package manager, strong IDE support).
    *   **FreeBASIC:** Relies primarily on the `fbc` compiler. Libraries are often managed manually or through community efforts. IDEs like FBEdit or Geany can simplify workflow.

*   **Simplicity vs. Features:**
    *   **FreeBASIC:** The `fbc` command is straightforward for its primary purpose: compilation.
    *   **Dart:** The `dart` command is a multi-tool for running, compiling, formatting, analyzing, and managing packages.

This README should give you a good starting point for understanding FreeBASIC syntax and how its command-line usage compares to Dart's.
